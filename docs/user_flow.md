# User Flow in the App

The course browser and legal tech competency review sections should be
self-explanatory. The general learning needs review, however, is more
complicated.

Note that:

1. Only users who specify that they work as legal support staff will be shown
   `/review/where`. The others jump straight to `/review/role`.
2. Only users who choose "Prepare for my next job role" will be shown
   `/review/nextrole`, which is a `RoleScreen` like `/review/role`, except that
   only the job roles in the same level or above will be shown.
