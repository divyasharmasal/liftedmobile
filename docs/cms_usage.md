# How to use the CMS

1. Navigate to [cms.lifted.sg](https://cms.lifted.sg/cms), preferably using a
desktop version of Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome.
2. Log in using your administrator username and password.

You now have three options to choose from on the sidebar:

1. Published courses
2. Unpublished courses
3. Scrapers

**Unpublished courses** lists course data which has not been listed on the app.
This data is created by the course scrapers. To publish a course, fill up its
details and click **Save**. All fields must be complete or the system will not
do so.  You can also delete an unpublished course by clicking **Delete**.

**Published courses** lists courses which is publicly viewable through the app.
To edit course data, change the field you wish to edit and click **Save**. You
can also delete a published course by clicking **Delete**, or manually add a
new course using the **+ Add Course** button on the top right of the screen.

**Scrapers** lets you run a scrape job for each third-party site. This page
also provides metadata such as when each third-party site was last scraped.
To run a scrape job, click on the **Scrape** button for that site. It usually
takes between 1 to 5 minutes per scrape. The scraper will automatically
populate the **Unpublished courses** page.
