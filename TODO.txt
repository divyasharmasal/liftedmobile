    - each course should have up to 3 LIFTED keys

- The scraped data must be connected to the diagnostic tool!
    - competency category only - broad matching.

- Error alerts via SendGrid - e.g. scraping and Django errors

- Funnel visitors from the course browser to the diagnostic

- Change diagnostic from smiley faces to I can... Yes/No

- Diag heading should be the job role heading + some copytext
    - "As a/an Legal Technologist..." - just the current job

- lifted.sg - use this domain

- Legal support vertical job roles should now be split into general +
  specialisms, just like LP. Use the same role picker as LP.
  e.g. Paralegal (civil litigation specialist)

- End-Nov beta release

- End-Nov: Submit phase 2 proposal: heatmap, scraping of books, scraping of
  AP site, law school event pages, tagging of books, recommended
