- When recommending courses, if there are no results, then don't show
  results. Only show results for exactly what the user selects.

- Diagnostic screen - leave out first line in the description since
  it's the same as the comp. description


- Preferred sorting metrics:
    1. CPD points
    2. Dates and cost - equally impt

- Filter for price - not necessary - demand for price is not elastic,
  and there are not enough programmes
- Filter for date - more useful. People generally know when they are
  free or not.
- Filter for competency category - yes.
